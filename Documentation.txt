PROJECT ONE DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------------
What is it?
 - An API and website in which you can store and access dungeons and dragons NPCs

What does it handle?
 - You can GET a random or named character, you can POST a new character to the database, and you can DELETE characters that are already in the database

Right and wrong
 - Time management was really good at the start, but then ended up being really bad at the end, some personal things came up that made it difficult to work on
 - Putting off styling until the last second made me feel rushed, even though I had a fully functioning app

Future work
 - Better styling
 - Allow you to search by different attributes of the characters

Above and beyond
 - I think that my app isn't crazy above and beyond, but I think I put a lot of work into making sure that there was a lot of data to be stored and accessed
from the server. This allows me to keep a more detailed account of what the NPC is, making it a more useful API and application.
